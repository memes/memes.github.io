I think it's about time this blog was brought back from the brink of
death! I'm going to post more often on the stuff I'm working on, and
about things in general.

#### Minimal Tracking
Quick note about tracking and cookies - I've decided not to use
Disqus, or other third-party discussion options because I don't
want to add to the cookies I'm setting. I am using Google Analytics to
track visits and see what content is being accessed; I don't care
about unique visits or other details. Clean your cookies!

* [Privacy Badger](https://www.eff.org/privacybadger)
* [Vanilla Cookie Manager](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vanilla-cookie-manager/gieohaicffldbmiilohhggbidhephnjj?hl=en)

I use both and can recommend them to minimise tracking.
