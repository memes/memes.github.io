The topic for August's OC GCP meetup is *"Introduction to Serverless on
GCP"*; please join me as I talk about [Cloud
Functions](https://cloud.google.com/functions/) and how to use them
with other Google APIs. I will give a quick demonstration of how to
string together [Cloud Speech API](https://cloud.google.com/speech/)
and [Cloud Translation API](https://cloud.google.com/translate/) using Node.js
to automatically process audio files uploaded to [Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage/) bucket.
