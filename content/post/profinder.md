I responded to my first Profinder request earlier today, and I am
curious to see how well it works in practice. Seems like people simply
fill in a form with a few key items, and LinkedIn mines it's database
for matching profiles that have signed up for Profinder.

I don't know how well this will work out for development projects, as
the details as provided by the potential client are not very detailed
and I can see how there will be a lot of back and forth in order to
create a realistic proposal, but I'm willing to give it a shot.

I'll report back if there are updates.
