The topic for September's OC GCP meetup has been chosen by vote to be
about *"Containers on GCP"*; please join me as I talk about the various
ways to deploy a containerised solution on GCP. IaaS, PaaS-ish and
CaaS will be discussed and examples given for each.

See you at Neudesic HQ on Tuesday September 26th.
