      <description>I responded to my first Profinder request earlier today, and I am curious to see how well it works in practice. Seems like people simply fill in a form with a few key items, and LinkedIn mines it&amp;rsquo;s database for matching profiles that have signed up for Profinder.
I don&amp;rsquo;t know how well this will work out for development projects, as the details as provided by the potential client are not very detailed and I can see how there will be a lot of back and forth in order to create a realistic proposal, but I&amp;rsquo;m willing to give it a shot.</description>
