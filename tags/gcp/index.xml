      <title>Migrate OC GCP domain to Google Cloud Platform, with DNSSEC enabled</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As the demos for &lt;a href=&#34;https://meetup.com/oc-gcp/&#34;&gt;OC GCP Meetup&lt;/a&gt; get
better and more interactive, I thought it was time to have a single
domain that can be used to access them and to host future demos. This
post, and the &lt;a href=&#34;https://matthewemes.com/series/migrating-to-gcp&#34;&gt;others&lt;/a&gt; that follow, will
show how to migrate or setup a new domain to use GCP services exclusively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First step in the process is to transfer DNS responsibilities to &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/dns/&#34;&gt;Cloud
DNS&lt;/a&gt;; I&amp;rsquo;ll be using ocgcp.com domain in
these examples, but nothing here is unique to our meetup. Since it&amp;rsquo;s
2017, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dnssec.net/&#34;&gt;DNSSEC&lt;/a&gt; will be enabled to offer as
much protection to our domain as possible.
