>OC GCP Meetup&lt;/a> get
better and more interactive, I thought it was time to have a single
domain that can be used to access them and to host future demos. This
post, and the &lt;a
href="https://matthewemes.com/series/migrating-to-gcp"
>others&lt;/a> that follow, will
show how to migrate or setup a new domain to use GCP services exclusively.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First step in the process is to transfer DNS responsibilities to &lt;a
href="https://cloud.google.com/dns/"
class="link--external" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
>Cloud
DNS&lt;/a>; I&amp;rsquo;ll be using ocgcp.com domain in
these examples, but nothing here is unique to our meetup. Since it&amp;rsquo;s
2017, &lt;a
href="http://www.dnssec.net/"
class="link--external" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
>DNSSEC&lt;/a> will be enabled to offer as
much protection to our domain as possible.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>OC Google Cloud Platform Meetup - October 2017</title><link>https://matthewemes.com/2017/10/oc-google-cloud-platform-meetup-october-2017/</link><pubDate>Wed, 11 Oct 2017 17:33:41 +0000</pubDate><author>memes@matthewemes.com (Matthew Emes)</author><guid>https://matthewemes.com/2017/10/oc-google-cloud-platform-meetup-october-2017/</guid><description>The topic for October&amp;rsquo;s meetup is &amp;ldquo;Cloud IoT Core by Example&amp;rdquo; - please RSVP here.</description></item><item><title>OC Google Cloud Platform Meetup - September 2017 - links</title><link>https://matthewemes.com/2017/09/oc-google-cloud-platform-meetup-september-2017-links/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Sep 2017 14:31:46 +0000</pubDate><author>memes@matthewemes.com (Matthew Emes)</author><guid>https://matthewemes.com/2017/09/oc-google-cloud-platform-meetup-september-2017-links/</guid><description>&lt;p>Thanks to those that were able to attend the meeting last night.
