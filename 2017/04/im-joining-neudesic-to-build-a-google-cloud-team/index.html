This post, and the others that follow, will show how to migrate or setup a new domain to use GCP services exclusively.
First step in the process is to transfer DNS responsibilities to Cloud DNS ; I&rsquo;ll be using ocgcp.com domain in these examples, but nothing here is unique to our meetup. Since it&rsquo;s 2017, DNSSEC will be enabled to offer as much protection to our domain as possible.
1. Create a zone in Cloud DNS for the domain The first step is to create a new zone for the domain and to enable DNSSEC. This can be achieved simply by using gcloud beta dns command to create the zone and turn on DNSSEC.
$ gcloud beta dns managed-zones create ocgcp-root \\ --dns-name=ocgcp.com \\ --dnssec-state on \\ --description=&#34;Root zone for ocgcp.com with DNSSEC enabled&#34; Created [https://www.googleapis.com/dns/v1beta2/projects/ocgcp-projects/managedZones/ocgcp-root]. 2. Add record sets to the zone Cloud DNS will process changes to record sets within a transaction, resulting in an all or nothing change to the zone.
2.1 Start the transaction $ gcloud dns record-sets transaction start \\ --zone=ocgcp-root Transaction started [transaction.yaml]. 2.2 Add Google Webmaster domain verification record I add a CNAME record to make sure that Google&rsquo;s tools can verify that the domain is owned by me. Usually this is a TXT record to avoid polluting sub-domains, but since I use a TXT record for SPF (way more important than this entry) I have to use CNAME option for verification.
$ gcloud dns record-sets transaction add \\ --ttl=3600 \\ --type=CNAME \\ --zone=ocgcp-root --name=n55v23lwpel4.ocgcp.com. \\ gv-atfe4vdgdiwhdg.dv.googlehosted.com. Record addition appended to transaction at [transaction.yaml]. 2.3 Add email records I use an alias domain for ocgcp.com, so MX records for gmail and a simple SPF rule are needed. Note that all MX servers are added in a single MX entry; spaces will be used as record markers, so the space between priority and server must be escaped so that it is not interpreted as a record demarcation.
$ gcloud dns record-sets transaction add \\ --name=ocgcp.com. \\ --ttl=3600 \\ --type=MX \\ --zone=ocgcp-root \\ 1\\ ASPMX.L.GOOGLE.COM. 5\\ ALT1.ASPMX.L.GOOGLE.COM. 5\\ ALT2.ASPMX.L.GOOGLE.COM. 10\\ ALT3.ASPMX.L.GOOGLE.COM. 10\\ ALT4.ASPMX.L.GOOGLE.COM. Record addition appended to transaction at [transaction.yaml]. $ gcloud dns record-sets transaction add \\ --name=ocgcp.com. \\ --ttl=3600 \\ --type=TXT \\ --zone=ocgcp-root \\ &#34;\\&#34;v=spf1 include:_spf.google.com ~all\\&#34;&#34; Record addition appended to transaction at [transaction.yaml]. Finally, add the DKIM record; note that the value has to be broken into pieces of 255 bytes or less surrounded by embedded double-quotes.
$ gcloud dns record-sets transaction add \\ --name=ocgcp.com. \\ --ttl=3600 \\ --type=TXT \\ --zone=ocgcp-root \\ --name=google._domainkey.ocgcp.com \\ &#34;\\&#34;v=DKIM1; k=rsa; p=MIIBIjANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQEFAAOCAQ8AMIIBCgKCAQEAi00VSESgcIZhr7nnDqCZ4nZqe4CEM/lqqzKmkoWrzYeTPU7cmzqZ/THD44V6+ftNZexplaDaQN1K+qywWXaocyjaefDUv9BPZzPZ7yPz+udDGa0Q7xT0AcTJApJwjaUJ5Hg/\\&#34; \\&#34;Gju26lV96IZv/QzHAVbgleE5gO89stM/TFpgjFquXObLFgZZDT/nG++sYTL3K10rcloOBvjTncI50mgV0Wd1+5CVeRyAUZUS7LodgSqYUZswJwFidRz/0AYjTd62+kvvHwKerRU7CNlbr5SI23l5//OG+9cBy7LFCGZkRcyvK/oxL7LBb2be4HckJL6uYDzByGzVbfjLY+xyXwfHVwIDAQAB\\&#34;&#34; Record addition appended to transaction at [transaction.yaml]. 2.4 Add CNAME for hosting from GCS We have a simple website ready to roll, and since it&rsquo;s fully static it can be served from Google Cloud Storage bucket. Unfortunately, GCS doesn&rsquo;t permit hosting the root domain from a bucket, but we can start with a www sub-domain.
$ gcloud dns record-sets transaction add \\ --ttl=3600 \\ --type=CNAME \\ --zone=ocgcp-root --name=www.ocgcp.com. \\ c.storage.googleapis.com. Record addition appended to transaction at [transaction.yaml]. 2.5 Commit the transaction Executing (committing) the transaction will apply all the record set changes in one operation.
$ gcloud dns record-sets transaction execute --zone=ocgcp-root Executed transaction [transaction.yaml] for managed-zone [ocgcp-root]. Created [https://www.googleapis.com/dns/v1/projects/ocgcp-projects/managedZones/ocgcp-root/changes/2]. ID START_TIME STATUS 2 2017-11-10T20:17:32.438Z pending Assuming there are no errors, the additional record sets added above will be present.
3. Host the static website on GCS In a later post, I&rsquo;ll walk through making a dynamic site with content from Container or App Engine, but for now a simple static site will demonstrate that the domain is up and running.
Note: The biggest issue with this approach in 2017 is that the content can only be served via HTTP; GCS will not serve the content as HTTPS. We&rsquo;ll address that once the site is dynamically hosted.
3.1 Create a new bucket for the site $ gsutil mb gs://www.ocgcp.com/ Creating gs://www.ocgcp.com/... $ gsutil defacl ch -u AllUsers:R gs://www.ocgcp.com Updated default ACL on gs://www.ocgcp.com/ 3.2 Transfer the site files to the bucket $ gsutil -m rsync -R ./ gs://www.ocgcp.com/ Building synchronization state...

$ gsutil web set -m index.html -e index.html gs://www.ocgcp.com Setting website configuration on gs://www.ocgcp.com/... 4. Update Domain Registration settings Follow the instructions provided by your domain registrar to update the name servers for the domain. The new name servers to use are:-
ns-cloud-e1.googledomains.com ns-cloud-e2.googledomains.com ns-cloud-e3.googledomains.com ns-cloud-e4.googledomains.com Configuring DNSSEC will require that your domain registrar supports adding the DNSSEC keys and configuration for your domain. Even though Cloud DNS will be providing all lookups, DNSSEC requires that the keys be registered at the original domain registrar.
4.1 Complete DNSSEC registration with original registrar Assuming that your domain registrar does support DNSSEC, the next step is to find the DNSSEC key and configuration. You can get this from Network Services / Cloud DNS section of cloud console, or from the trusty command line.
First, list the keys associated with the newly created zone.
$ gcloud gcloud beta dns dnskeys list --zone=ocgcp-root ID KEY_TAG TYPE IS_ACTIVE DESCRIPTION 0 60071 keySigning True 1 36546 zoneSigning True The keySiging entry is the one that is needed here; in the output it is the key with ID 0. Describing that key will provide the details needed for domain registrar.
$ gcloud beta dns dnskeys describe 0 --zone=ocgcp-root algorithm: rsasha256 creationTime: &#39;2017-11-10T18:02:06.346Z&#39; digests: - digest: 3109B7DB8ABC274BDD259928F0C81118D386E299090E70C0F2BCAA22A3240E5F type: sha256 dsRecord: 60071 8 2 3109B7DB8ABC274BDD259928F0C81118D386E299090E70C0F2BCAA22A3240E5F id: &#39;0&#39; isActive: true keyLength: 2048 keyTag: 60071 kind: dns#dnsKey publicKey: AwEAAYOdwvK//Y13cwUy7OYbDFC0XYRby96ZHZ+VxuRGj1S5EmkVbtCfB/KKDjVXlfqjXAYJJjxSi2r3hNE07mSmrrGGPRY8bJ3qOxFpjXnP+4aiuzoY4W1GHuLhI90/tlSf9lDjiAQ8c8nXNBNB0v57NO37d1du/1Mu80SzrcucuBHZORJDFMC/nnhL6bjUEEF1OQzSJ3qvtX+noKA4xfe9m60FJ1oYj1cH9sV7Mvj8BOhna272sEWQJXTPgsJWi61ASxxuDHiNHIJtx8hQU6jCBCXeAfJmg9+1hO7dUdOvtb+LLTmYS6gZP/EZ5cKgSh5HkDYCAqrsoiQxozuA+eiHAYk= type: keySigning Modify the DNSSEC records for your domain registrar, using the values for keyTag, algorithm, digest, and digest type.
Once complete, you can verify DNSSEC is working by using Verisign&rsquo;s DNSSEC Analyzer ; it will analyse your DNS records and confirm that DNSSEC is setup completely.
The image below shows the output from the analyzer for ocgcp.com.
5. Verify the site is running Finally, open www.ocgcp.com in a browser to confirm the site is loading and that DNS is working correctly.
Success!

No problem to do so on Linux and Windows, but I encountered some problems when doing so for Termux and Chromebook. This post details how to resolve the issue on a Chromebook or other locked down environment.
During installation the Azure CLI script assumes it can install dependencies to a location forbidden by Android (and Termux). On a hunch I guessed this could be resolved by a user folder virtual environment, instead of a system install, and with a little investigation of exceptions, I was able to get az cli working just fine.
1. Install the python packages into a virtual environment These steps are essentially what the standard Azure CLI install does, but this method installs ffi and other dependencies into a virtualenv to avoid problems with Android file permissions.
$ pkg install openssl-dev libffi-dev python-dev python $ pip install --user virtualenv $ virtualenv /home/lib/azure-cli $ /home/lib/azure-cli/bin/pip install cffi $ /home/lib/azure-cli/bin/pip install azure-cli $ /home/lib/azure-cli/bin/pip install --upgrade --force-reinstall azure-nspkg azure-mgmt-nspkg 2. Add shell script for command completion Create az.completion in /home/lib/azure-cli, or wherever you installed Azure CLI files to have command completion.
Note that IFS in line 2 is a Ctrl-K; download the raw file from gist if needed.
3. Enable bash command completion Edit ~/.bashrc to include completion support for Azure CLI; in my example below I add Azure CLI completion on the last line.
4. Create a shell script to invoke Azure CLI Create the script az and add it to path; mine is in /home/bin/az

I think that libcurl3 is only used when downloading framework and can be reset when done.
As part of a series of posts on deploying .NET Core applications to GKE, I had to install .NET Core SDK to my Debian laptop and make it work correctly. curl and gettext packages were already installed, so only libunwind8 was required.
$ sudo apt-get install libunwind8 $ mkdir -p ~/lib/.net $ curl -sSL https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=848826 | tar xvzC ~/lib/.net/ After installation, I tried to run dotnet and it worked, but any arguments to dotnet caused a problem.
$ ~/lib/.net/dotnet Microsoft .NET Core Shared Framework Host ... $ ~/lib/.net/dotnet -h Failed to initialize CoreCLR, HRESULT: 0x80131500 I figured that this was because .NET Core SDK is supported on Debian Stable, and I tend to run a mix of Testing/Sid packages. Quick check for missing libraries showed a few candidates, and most were easily resolved, with the exception of liblldb-3.6 for which a package could not be found.

The command works, but trying to create a project generates a segfault. A quick Googling found a bugreport; segfault due to curl/libcurl3 using a more recent version of libssl than .NET Core. Downgrading the package fixed the problem.

Seems like people simply fill in a form with a few key items, and LinkedIn mines it&rsquo;s database for matching profiles that have signed up for Profinder.
I don&rsquo;t know how well this will work out for development projects, as the details as provided by the potential client are not very detailed and I can see how there will be a lot of back and forth in order to create a realistic proposal, but I&rsquo;m willing to give it a shot.
I&rsquo;ll report back if there are updates.
