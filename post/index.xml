get
better and more interactive, I thought it was time to have a single
domain that can be used to access them and to host future demos. This
post, and the &lt;a href="https://matthewemes.com/series/migrating-to-gcp" >others&lt;/a>
that follow, will
show how to migrate or setup a new domain to use GCP services exclusively.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First step in the process is to transfer DNS responsibilities to &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/dns/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Cloud
DNS&lt;/a>
; I&amp;rsquo;ll be using ocgcp.com domain in
these examples, but nothing here is unique to our meetup. Since it&amp;rsquo;s
2017, &lt;a href="http://www.dnssec.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">DNSSEC&lt;/a>
will be enabled to offer as
much protection to our domain as possible.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>OC Google Cloud Platform Meetup - October 2017</title><link>https://matthewemes.com/2017/10/oc-google-cloud-platform-meetup-october-2017/</link><pubDate>Wed, 11 Oct 2017 17:33:41 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://matthewemes.com/2017/10/oc-google-cloud-platform-meetup-october-2017/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;p class="imgp">

services and as part of that task I naturally wanted to install the
CLI. No problem to do so on Linux and Windows, but I encountered some
problems when doing so for Termux and Chromebook. This post details
how to resolve the issue on a Chromebook or other locked down
environment.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>OC Google Cloud Platform Meetup - September 2017 - links</title><link>https://matthewemes.com/2017/09/oc-google-cloud-platform-meetup-september-2017-links/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Sep 2017 14:31:46 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://matthewemes.com/2017/09/oc-google-cloud-platform-meetup-september-2017-links/</guid><description>&lt;p>Thanks to those that were able to attend the meeting last night.

&lt;h2 id="tldr">tl;dr&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>install missing packages libicu52, libssl1.0.0 and liblttng-ust0&lt;/li>
&lt;li>downgrade curl to &lt;code>stable&lt;/code> release 7.38.0-4+deb8u5&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>Accidentally released the hold on &lt;code>curl&lt;/code>/&lt;code>libcurl3&lt;/code>, and &lt;code>dotnet&lt;/code>
command still works. I think that &lt;code>libcurl3&lt;/code> is only used when
downloading framework and can be reset when done.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>As part of a series of posts on deploying .NET Core applications to
GKE, I had to install .NET Core SDK to my Debian laptop and make it
work correctly. &lt;code>curl&lt;/code> and &lt;code>gettext&lt;/code> packages were already installed, so
only &lt;code>libunwind8&lt;/code> was required.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Google Certified Professional Cloud Architect</title><link>https://matthewemes.com/2017/05/google-certified-professional-cloud-architect/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 May 2017 13:25:21 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://matthewemes.com/2017/05/google-certified-professional-cloud-architect/</guid><description>&lt;p>Today I passed my exam to become &lt;strong>Google Certified Professional Cloud

curious to see how well it works in practice. Seems like people simply
fill in a form with a few key items, and LinkedIn mines it&amp;rsquo;s database
for matching profiles that have signed up for Profinder.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I don&amp;rsquo;t know how well this will work out for development projects, as
the details as provided by the potential client are not very detailed
and I can see how there will be a lot of back and forth in order to
create a realistic proposal, but I&amp;rsquo;m willing to give it a shot.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>New blog</title><link>https://matthewemes.com/2017/02/new-blog/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Feb 2017 15:32:25 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://matthewemes.com/2017/02/new-blog/</guid><description>&lt;p>I think it&amp;rsquo;s about time this blog was brought back from the brink of
death! I&amp;rsquo;m going to post more often on the stuff I&amp;rsquo;m working on, and
about things in general.&lt;/p>
