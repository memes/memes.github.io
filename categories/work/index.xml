      <description>Installing .NET Core SDK on Debian Testing  tl;dr * install missing packages libicu52, libssl1.0.0 and liblttng-ust0 * downgrade curl to stable release 7.38.0-4+deb8u5
 Update 6/11/2017:-
 Accidentally released the hold on curl/libcurl3, and dotnet command still works. I think that libcurl3 is only used when downloading framework and can be reset when done.
 As part of a series of posts on deploying .NET Core applications to GKE, I had to install .</description>

      <description> Today I passed my exam to become Google Certified Professional Cloud Architect! Glad that&amp;rsquo;s out the way, and I can now focus on building the practice at Neudesic.
Update: May 18 2017 Now I have the certificate to embed. Fair warning, this thing sets so many cookies and trackers that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t work with Privacy Badger enabled, and is definitely an exception to my minimal tracking stance.

      <description>I responded to my first Profinder request earlier today, and I am curious to see how well it works in practice. Seems like people simply fill in a form with a few key items, and LinkedIn mines it&amp;rsquo;s database for matching profiles that have signed up for Profinder.
I don&amp;rsquo;t know how well this will work out for development projects, as the details as provided by the potential client are not very detailed and I can see how there will be a lot of back and forth in order to create a realistic proposal, but I&amp;rsquo;m willing to give it a shot.</description>
