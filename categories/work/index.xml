      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was asked to contribute to a white-paper for Azure container
services and as part of that task I naturally wanted to install the
CLI. No problem to do so on Linux and Windows, but I encountered some
problems when doing so for Termux and Chromebook. This post details
how to resolve the issue on a Chromebook or other locked down
environment.

      <description>Installing .NET Core SDK on Debian Testing tl;dr  install missing packages libicu52, libssl1.0.0 and liblttng-ust0 downgrade curl to stable release 7.38.0-4+deb8u5   Update 6/11/2017:- Accidentally released the hold on curl/libcurl3, and dotnet command still works. I think that libcurl3 is only used when downloading framework and can be reset when done.
 As part of a series of posts on deploying .NET Core applications to GKE, I had to install .</description>

      <title>Profinder</title>

      <description>I responded to my first Profinder request earlier today, and I am curious to see how well it works in practice. Seems like people simply fill in a form with a few key items, and LinkedIn mines it&amp;rsquo;s database for matching profiles that have signed up for Profinder.
I don&amp;rsquo;t know how well this will work out for development projects, as the details as provided by the potential client are not very detailed and I can see how there will be a lot of back and forth in order to create a realistic proposal, but I&amp;rsquo;m willing to give it a shot.</description>
